HAC data:

- clustering of text instead of numbers, so final entity would be text (multiple words)

- vectorize a text and form a unit vector and then do distance between them

- normalization of vector gives high dimensional vector


- L1 or L2 distance, use priority queue for O(n^2) distances.

- make a concrete algorithm
